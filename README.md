# qualtrics_checks


I will use this repo to check what happens when I change data in Qualtrics.

Specifically, I will:

- create a simple Qualtrics survey:
  - two conditions (A and B) with random assignment
  - within each condition, one question that is shown only to that group
  - a second question that is shown to all participants, no matter the group

After setting up the survey:
1. answer the survey. Enter text to each of the questions. 6 responses, hopefully this means 3 / condition
2. download the data using the default settings in qualtrics
3. change one response in the browser (Data & Analysis tab)
4. retake another response and make no change
5. retake another response and make one change
6. when retaking the responses, pay attention to which condition I am assigned to this time
